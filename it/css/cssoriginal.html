					<p>Why would a robot need to drink? Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Daddy Bender, we're hungry.</p>
					<p>Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! <strong> Belligerent and numerous.</strong> <em> And why did 'I' have to take a cab?</em>  And why did 'I' have to take a cab?</p>
				<h2>Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"!</h2>

					<li>Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.</li>
					<li>Bender, you risked your life to save me!</li>
					<li>Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!</li>
				</ol>
					<p>I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! That's not soon enough! Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.</p>
					<p>Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Bender, we're trying our best. Why yes! Thanks for noticing. <strong> It's okay, Bender.</strong> <em> I like cooking too.</em> And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.</p>

					<h3>Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?</h3>
						<p>You don't know how to do any of those. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? Throw her in the brig. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Guess again.</li>
						<li>You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.</li>

						<p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> example of an abbreviation</p>
						<p>Throw her in the brig. Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.</p>
						<p>Hey, whatcha watching? Tell her she looks thin. Kif might! For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! What kind of a father would I be if I said no?</p>

					<h3>Well, then good news! It's a suppository.</h3>
						<p>With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Soon enough. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!</p>
						<p>Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.</p>
						<p>Oh God, what have I done? Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! I'll get my kit! Anyone who laughs is a communist! As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.</p>
						<p>Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! It doesn't look so shiny to me.</p>

						<p>Large bet on myself in round one. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!</p>

Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.</p>
						<p>Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. It's a T. It goes "tuh". No. We're on the top.</p>

						<p>Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." When will that be? Oh yeah, good luck with that. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!</p>
						<p>I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. No. We're on the top. Daddy Bender, we're hungry.</p>
						<p>Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Is that a cooking show? Meh. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!</p>
						<p>Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? Ow, my spirit! Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…</p>
						<p>Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Ow, my spirit! Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!</p>
				</div>

					<h3>Bender, we're trying our best.</h3>
						<p>Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</p>
						<p>You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. File not found. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.</p>
						<p>I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. When will that be? Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!</p>
						<p>Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.</p>
						<p>Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.</p>

					<h3>In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.</h3>
						<p>Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? Take me to your leader! Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?</p>

						<p>That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.</p>
						<p>Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. And I'm his friend Jesus. Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?</p>

					<h3>You know, I was God once.</h3>
						<p>Bender?! You stole the atom. Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying!</li><li>Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</li><li>Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.</li>
					</ul>
						<p>Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.</p>
